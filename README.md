## Python Setup

Students have the option to run the code *online* with Google Colab (requires a Google account) or *locally* with your own installation of Python and an editor (I recommend Visual Studio Code).

#### Online: 
Everything runs on a Google machine, so you don't need to set up anything on your computer. Furthermore, the machines come with the most popular libraries preinstalled. 
Just click on the corresponding Open in Colab badge: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](#tutorials).

#### Local:
Install Python on your computer via [Conda/Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html) or the [Python Installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Use Python3, as Python2 is not supported anymore. Furthermore, you need an Editor that supports Jupyter (`.ipynb`)  notebooks. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Optionally, you can also use a local server and open [Notebooks in your browser](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) (Visual Studio simplifies this).

## Course Grading
This course will be graded based on your performance in the **course homeworks**. 
The homework will be announced while we progress through the course.

Furthermore, you will give an **oral presentation** about a related computer vision field.
The topic of your presentation is free to choose (as long as it is CV related). 
Focus on a Computer-Vision task/algorithm (a scientific work), understand its details (advantages, limitations, competition, ...), and explain it to your fellow students. 

IMPORTANT: Pick a fun topic that **interests you**! You can find further details [here](../images/RW.md) and an inspiration for topics [here](../images/TOPICS.md).
