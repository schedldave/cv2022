# CV Course Project 
The topic of your project is free to choose, but it must be Computer Vision related. Focus on a Computer-Vision algorithm, understand its details, and implement it from scratch. You can work with your data or use existing databases (images, videos, …) on a fun topic that interests you. Look at the intro slides for some inspiration! 
Your project can also be very application-oriented; for example; does this algorithm work on this dataset, or on this task (which might be very different from its original purpose). Creating an application that is very nicely designed and user-friendly (with a CV algorithm somewhere in the pipeline) is allowed, but keep in mind that for this course the CV algorithm is important. Your understanding of the algorithm and your performance when you implement it is the basis for your grade.
Too simple/easy topics and solutions will result in an average grade (C or Befriedigend). I will tell you when you announce your project. Note that you can send me proposals before the deadline. If you produce a very innovative/detailed solution for a simple problem the grade will improve. 

The project is the only homework of the course, so you should spend some time on the project. Expect to work around 100 hours, or more, on the project (research, preparing presentations, implementation, and documentation) and allocate time for it!

The deliverables for the course project are the announcements of your idea and your team, two presentations, where one covers related work and the other covers your final results, and a project report (and supplementary files if needed). 

### Presentations
For presentations (of Part 1 and 2) you will have a maximum of 10 minutes for your talk plus 5 minutes for questions. Your goal is to present something interesting to your fellow students, so they learn something from your talk. Every team member should present once. So either student A presents the first presentation and student B the second, or you split every presentation 50/50.

## Part 0 - Announcement
Announce your team and the topic you want to work on via Elearning. If you submit early and want early feedback, please notify me via mail (david.schedl@gmail.com).
In the announcement you should be able to answer the following questions: 
- Who is on your team (names of one or two student(s) )?
- What is the problem/question that you will be investigating? 
- What data can you use? 
- Did you find existing methods, already? Are their implementations available?
- How will you evaluate your results?
- Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)
- Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?

I will notify you if the project topic is okay and what grade to expect if you succeed. 
Note that for the announcement you already need to look at some related work, which will help you for the next part.

## Part 1 - Related Work
The first objective for your project is to carry out a bibliographic study and present the result to the class. Choose some papers (not less than two, preferably not more than five) that are closely related to your project idea. Papers should be interesting and not too hard to follow.
The lists (provided below) might be a starting point to initiating the study and are by no means a constraint. You will also find papers through citations. Study the papers in depth. Find how they are connected. Pay attention to related work and, through citations, try to identify papers that are more relevant, more interesting, or more recent. Note that you don’t need to implement the best or most recent algorithms. Also, present the (planned) basis for your implementation. 
For the related work presentation, you will be evaluated based on your choice of papers, the way you have connected them into a story, and how you present them. You should focus on the main ideas. Implementation details are irrelevant at this stage of the project. 
During the presentation you should answer the following major questions:
- What are the most relevant readings? (2-5 papers) 
- What are the existing methods? 
- What method or algorithm will you (most likely) use in your project? 

## Part 2 - Implementation and Evaluation
Focus on a Computer-Vision algorithm understand its details and implement it (almost) from scratch, and evaluate its performance. A user interface or user-friendliness is not important for this course project (but is allowed, of course). Don’t use an already existing implementation and just apply it. Start from scratch and understand what you are doing. 
You don’t need to use Python for your implementation, but I highly recommend it, since we use it in the course and I will be able to help you if there are programming-related problems (in the Q&A session).
If there is an implementation available already, you can use it for debugging and for evaluation. You are allowed to use libraries up to a certain limit. For example, you can use OpenCV and some of its features for filtering and image manipulation, or TensorFlow/PyTorch/etc. to set up and run Neural Networks. However, you should not use available detectors (e.g., a face detector) or pre-trained networks, if they are the main goal of your project. In certain projects, however, it might be okay to use them (if in doubt, always ask me).

Finally, present your results to your fellow students in an understandable way, so that they can learn something from your talk. In the presentation, you should describe and evaluate what you did in your project, which may not necessarily be what you hoped to do originally (announcement and related work). For evaluation show some results of your approach and also demonstrate its limits. Give an outlook on what steps you would have taken in the future. 
During the presentation you should answer the following major questions:
- What is the problem/question that you solved? 
- What method or algorithm did you use in your project? 
- What data did you use for evaluation? 
- What simplifications or assumptions have you taken?
- If available, how do other implementations compare to yours (Note: it is okay if they are better)?
- How did you evaluate your results?
- What are the limitations of your work?
- How can you overcome the limitations in the future?

## Part 3 - Report
The report should be structured like a research paper, with sections for introduction, related work, the approach/algorithm, experimental results, conclusions, and references. Project reports should be submitted by each team member. If there is an unequal distribution of contributions within your team describe it in the report (e.g., student A did 60% of the work while B only did 40%), and I will consider it for grading. 
You should describe and evaluate what you did in your project, which may not necessarily be what you hoped to do originally (announcement and related work). 
In principle, the related work section will contain what you presented in part 1, while the algorithm and result sections describe what you presented in the final presentation (Part 2). 
Keep the sections short and to the point. For example, a small result described and evaluated well will earn more credit than an ambitious result where no aspect was done well. Be accurate in describing the problem you tried to solve. Explain in detail your approach, and specify any simplifications or assumptions you have taken. Also, demonstrate the limitations of your approach. When doesn’t it work? Why? What steps would you have taken have you continued working on it? Make sure to add references to all related work you reviewed or used (also in the related work presentation). 
You are allowed to submit any supplementary material that you think is important to evaluate your work (e.g., images, videos), but make your report as self-containing as possible. It should be possible to understand your algorithm from the report only.
